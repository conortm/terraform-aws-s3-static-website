# AWS S3 Static Website Terraform Module

[Terraform Module](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/conortm/s3-static-website) for an Amazon S3 Static Website, fronted by a CloundFront Distribution.

**Note:** This module "works" but is still in development. See [TODO section](#todo). Also, suggestions welcome!

## Features

This module allows for [Hosting a Static Website on Amazon S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/WebsiteHosting.html), provisioning the following:

- S3 Bucket for static public files
- CloudFront Distribution fronting the S3 Bucket
- Route 53 Record Set aliased to the CloudFront Distribution

It requires (for now?) that the following have been setup outside this module:

- SSL Certificate
- Route 53 Hosted Zone

## Usage

```HCL
module "s3-static-website" {
  source  = "conortm/s3-static-website/aws"

  domain_name = "www.my-aws-s3-static-website.com"
  redirects   = {
      "my-static-website" : "my-aws-s3-static-website.com"
  }
  secret      = "SOME_SECRET_MANAGED_OUTSIDE_OF_VERSION_CONTROL"
  cert_arn    = "ARN_OF_SSL_CERTIFICATE"
  zone_id     = "HOSTED_ZONE_ID"

  tags = {
    Foo = "Bar"
  }
}
```
